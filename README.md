# Haf

Haf is a fully typed persistent config solution for your NodeJS projects with a great developer experience! It's compatible with Linux, MacOS and Windows environments.

- Auto-completed dot-notation suggestions as you type when you try to get()/set()/delete()/reset() data from the store.
- The type of the value you get() from the store is correctly inferred. So you always know what you'll get().
- Non-nullable values aren't suggested on delete(). Trying to delete() a non-nullable field will get a type error.
